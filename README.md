## Design of probes to capture sites carrying fixed modern human-derived single-nucleotide changes (SNC)

Every SNC from the catalog of fixed modern human-derived changes [1] will be
overlapped by two 52bp probes, one will carry a derived allele (D) and the second
will carry an ancestral (archaic-like) allele (A). Two more probes will be
flanking the site without any overlap.

```
                              SNC
                     26bp      |      25bp
             <-----------------D---------------->
             <-----------------A---------------->
 <----------------------------> <---------------------------->
              52bp                           52bp
```
